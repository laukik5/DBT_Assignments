Rating”, while the others will have the words “Low Rating”.
Answer:	select cname,city,"High Rating" Rating from customers where rating>=200
	union 
	select cname,city,"Low Rating" Rating from customers where rating<200;

2) Write a command that produces the name and number of each salesperson and each customer with more than one current order. Put the results in alphabetical order.
Answer:	select cname,cnum as 'num1' from customers where cnum in (Select cnum from orders group by cnum having count(onum)>1)
 	union 
 	select sname,snum as 'num2' from salespeople where snum in(select snum from orders group by snum having count(onum)>1);


3) Form a union of three queries. Have the first select the snums of all salespeople in San Jose; 
   the second, the cnums of all customers in San Jose; 
   and the third the onums of all orders on October 3. Retain duplicates between the last two queries
   but eliminate any redundancies between either of them and the first.
   (Note: in the sample tables as given, there would be no such redundancy. This is besides the point.)
Answer: select snum from salespeople where city="San Jose" 
	union 
	select y.cnum from (select cnum from customers where city="San Jose"
	union all
	select onum from orders where odate like '%-10-03') as y;
